  Abstract                 = {A wide collection of popular statistical learning methods, ranging from K-means to Support Vector Machines through Neural Networks, can be formulated as a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm in a specific setup. In practice, the main limitation of this incremental optimization technique is due to the stochastic noise induced by the choice at random of the data involved in the gradient estimate computation at each iteration. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce a novel implementation of the SGD algorithm, where the data subset used at a given step is not picked uniformly at random among all possible subsets but drawn from a specific adaptive sampling scheme, depending on the past iterations in a Markovian manner, in order to refine the current statistical estimation of the gradient. Beyond an algorithmic description of the approach we propose, rate bounds are established and illustrative numerical results are displayed in order to provide theoretical and empirical evidence of its statistical performance, compared to more ``naive'' SGD implementations. Computational issues are also discussed at length, revealing the practical advantages of the method promoted.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a stratified sampling algorithm in which the random drawings made in the strata to compute the expectation of interest are also used to adaptively modify the proportion of further drawings in each stratum. These proportions converge to the optimal allocation in terms of variance reduction and our stratified estimator is asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance equal to the minimal one. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our algorithm. For the pricing of arithmetic average Asian options in the Black and Scholes model, the variance is divided by a factor going from 1.1 to 50.4 (depending on the option type and the moneyness) in comparison with the standard allocation procedure, while the increase in computation time does not overcome 1{\%}.},

  Abstract                 = {The subject of the paper -- (conservative) confidence intervals -- originates in applications to auditing. Auditors are interested in upper confidence bounds for an unknown mean $\mu$ for all sample sizes n. The samples are drawn from populations such that often only a few observations are nonzero. The conditional distribution of an observation given that it is nonzero usually has a very irregular shape. However, it can be assumed that observations are bounded. We propose a way to reduce the problem to inequalities for tail probabilities of certain relevant statistics. Note that a traditional approach involving limit theorems forces to impose additional conditions on regularity of samples and leads to approximate or asymptotic bounds. In the case of $\mu$, as a statistic we can use sample mean, say {\$}{\$}{\backslash}bar {\backslash}mu{\$}{\$}, and we have to use Hoeffding [7] inequalities, since currently they are the best available. This leads to upper confidence bounds for $\mu$ which are of (asymptotic) size at most {\$}{\$}b {\backslash}lesssim {\backslash}bar {\backslash}mu + 2.44{\backslash}sigma /{\backslash}sqrt n{\$}{\$}in the case of risk $\alpha$ =0.05, where $\sigma$ is the unknown standard deviation. We have {\$}{\$}(b - {\backslash}bar {\backslash}mu )/(b{\_}0 - {\backslash}bar {\backslash}mu ) {\backslash}leqslant 1.488{\$}{\$}, where {\$}{\$}b{\_}0 {\backslash}sim {\backslash}bar {\backslash}mu + 1.645{\backslash}sigma /{\backslash}sqrt n{\$}{\$}is the bound in a model with normally distributed observations. It seems that the bound is very robust and can be improved replacing Hoeffding's inequalities by more refined ones. The commonly used Stringer bound (it is still not known whether it is an upper confidence bound) is of asymptotic size {\$}{\$}{\backslash}bar {\backslash}mu + 1.645c/{\backslash}sqrt n{\$}{\$}c ⩾ $\sigma$ with equality only for Bernoulli distributions, and the ratio c / $\sigma$ can be arbitrary large already for rather simple distributions. Our bounds can involve a priori information (professional judgment of an auditor) of type $\mu$ ⩾ $\mu$0 or/and $\sigma$⩾ $\sigma$0, which leads to improvements. Most of the results also hold for sampling without replacement from finite populations. The i.i.d. condition can be replaced by a martingale-type dependence assumption. Finally, the results can be extended to the noni.i.d. case and for settings with several samples.},

A number of possible methods for the analysis of such exposure stratified case-cohort samples are presented, some of their statistical properties developed, and approximate relative efficiency and optimal allocation to the strata discussed. The methods are compared to each other, and to randomly sampled case-cohort studies, in a limited computer simulation study.

  Abstract                 = {The infinite dimensional Z-estimation theorem offers a systematic approach to joint estimation of both Euclidean and non-Euclidean parameters in probability models for data. It is easily adapted for stratified sampling designs. This is important in applications to censored survival data because the inverse probability weights that modify the standard estimating equations often depend on the entire follow-up history. Since the weights are not predictable, they complicate the usual theory based on martingales. This paper considers joint estimation of regression coefficients and baseline hazard functions in the Cox proportional and Lin--Ying additive hazards models. Weighted likelihood equations are used for the former and weighted estimating equations for the latter. Regression coefficients and baseline hazards may be combined to estimate individual survival probabilities. Efficiency is improved by calibrating or estimating the weights using information available for all subjects. Although inefficient in comparison with likelihood inference for incomplete data, which is often difficult to implement, the approach provides consistent estimates of desired population parameters even under model misspecification.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a general technique for the treatment of samples drawn without replacement from finite universes when unequal selection probabilities are used. Two sampling schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according to the information available in a supplementary variable. Admittedly, these two schemes have limited application. They should prove useful, however, for the first stage of sampling with multi-stage designs, since both permit unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without resorting to additional assumptions.},

The sample size/power calculation for a stratified CC (SCC) design has not been addressed before. This article derives such result based on a stratified test statistic. Simulation studies show that the proposed test for the SCC design utilizing small sub-cohort sampling fractions is valid and efficient for situations where the disease rate is low. Furthermore, optimization of sampling in the SCC design is discussed and compared with proportional and balanced sampling techniques. An epidemiological study is provided to illustrate the sample size calculation under the SCC design.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification, using the decision tree algorithm, is a widely studied problem in data streams. The challenge is when to split a decision node into multiple leaves. Concentration inequalities, that exploit variance information such as Bernstein's and Bennett's inequalities, are often substantially strict as compared with Hoeffding's bound which disregards variance. Many machine learning algorithms for stream classification such as very fast decision tree (VFDT) learner, AdaBoost and support vector machines (SVMs), use the Hoeffding's bound as a performance guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on the recently proposed empirical Bernstein's bound to achieve a better probabilistic bound on the accuracy of the decision tree. Experimental results on four synthetic and two real world data sets demonstrate the performance gain of our proposed technique.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a surprising though obvious result that seems to have been unnoticed until now. In particular, we demonstrate the equivalence of two well-known problems—the optimal allocation of the fixed overall sample size n among L strata under stratified random sampling and the optimal allocation of the H = 435 seats among the 50 states for apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives following each decennial census. In spite of the strong similarity manifest in the statements of the two problems, they have not been linked and they have well-known but different solutions; one solution is not explicitly exact (Neyman allocation), and the other (equal proportions) is exact. We give explicit exact solutions for both and note that the solutions are equivalent. In fact, we conclude by showing that both problems are special cases of a general problem. The result is significant for stratified random sampling in that it explicitly shows how to minimize sampling error var($\hat{T} _{Y}$) when estimating a total TY while keeping the final overall sample size fixed at n; this is usually not the case in practice with Neyman allocation where the resulting final overall sample size might be near n + L after rounding. An example reveals that controlled rounding with Neyman allocation does not always lead to the optimum allocation, that is, an allocation that minimizes variance.},
